Disney Characters
Yes, all started with a mouse. But since the creation of Mickey Mouse in 1928, hundreds of characters have been born from the imagination of Disney Studios. Some have known worldwide fame and success. Others appeared only a few times but have nevertheless contributed to the originality, humor and the freshness of Walt Disney productions.

The following is a list of the most popular Walt Disney Characters:

Mickey Mouse
Mickey Mouse was created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks and voiced by Walt Disney. He first appeared in Steamboat Willie. He evolved from being simply a character in animated cartoons and comic strips to become one of the most recognizable symbols in the world. His popularity is mainly due to his angelic nature.

Donald Duck
Donald Duck first appeared in the Silly Symphonies cartoon The Wise Little Hen on June 9, 1934. He is a white anthropomorphic duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. Donald's most famous personality trait is his easily provoked and explosive temper.

Goofy
Goofy is an anthropomorphic dog and is one of Mickey Mouse's best friends. His original concept name was "Dippy Dawg" in cartoon shorts created during the 1930s. Along with being predictably clumsy, Goofy is often shown as having little to no intelligence. But this interpretation isn't always definitive; occasionally, Goofy is shown as intuitive and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.

Pluto

Pluto, also called Pluto the Pup, is a cartoon dog created in 1930. He  most frequently appeared as Mickey Mouse's pet dog. He also had an independent starring role in 48 Disney shorts in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Pluto is unusual for a Disney character in that he is not anthropomorphized beyond showing an unusually broad range of facial expressions or use of his front paws at key points; he is actually represented as a normal dog (unlike Goofy who is an anthropomorphic dog)
