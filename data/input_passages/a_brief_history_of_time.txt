"A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes" is one of Stephen Hawking's bestsellers. It is a popular-science book on cosmology. Hawking first published the book in 1988 with the intention to explain difficult theoretical concepts to laymen.

Because Hawking wrote A Brief History of Time for nonspecialist readers with no prior knowledge of scientific theories, he used non-technical terms about the structure, origin, development and eventual fate of the universe, which is the object of study of astronomy and modern physics.

Throughout the chapters of the book, Hawking explains basic concepts like space and time, basic building blocks that make up the universe (such as quarks) and the fundamental forces that govern it (such as gravity). He also writes about cosmological phenomena such as the Big Bang and black holes. Professor Hawking also discusses two major theories that modern scientists use to describe the universe, namely general relativity and quantum mechanics. Finally, the book also discusses the search for a unifying theory that describes everything in the universe in a coherent manner. Recent advances in science have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of this book.

The book became a bestseller and sold more than 10 million copies in 20 years. It was also on the London Sunday Times bestseller list for more than five years and was translated into 35 languages by 2001.
