Many countries around the world celebrate Earth Day. It is a day that is meant to raise awareness and appreciation about the Earth's natural environment.

The first Earth Day was held in the USA. It was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in - a sort of general educational forum or seminar. That was on April 22, 1970. While this first Earth Day was focused on the United States, an organization launched by Denis Hayes, who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations.

Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network, and is celebrated in more than 175 countries every year. Numerous communities celebrate Earth Week, an entire week of activities focused on environmental issues. In 2009, the United Nations designated April 22 International Mother Earth Day.
